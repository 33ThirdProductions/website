		Draft script/ideas for the preview montage:
	  </div>
	  <div class="p">
		I'm thinking start with scenes of children running and playing
		together. Very sincere, no corny forshadowing, but we're clearly
		seeign better times. Everything in slow motion, with the scenes fading
		in and out, as if in the minds eye. This is memory. We get
		glimpes... like worried parents hushing themselves, scenes with clear
		double meanings... like pretending that running to the basement for an
		air raid call is because "Wouldn't it be fun to go camping tonight?"
		Could go "war" or just "poor". I actually don't have a clear sense of
		what time to set this. Could be future sci-fi-ish (sowewhat the
		aesthetic of "Chronicles of Ridick"). Future-kung fu is awesome. Or we
		could do some alternate or golden history type thing. Set in some kind
		of "imperial time" (though could work with many cultures as
		wel...). Or even place it in the present. "Near term sci-fi." An
		answer to the "post acopalypse" genre of the late 70s and eighties and
		nineties... that one may be my favorite.
	  </div>
	  <div class="p">
		"Two brothers, grew up as children at a time when many were forced to
		become adults too soon. But even the unquestioning love of their
		parents was not enough to shield them entirely..."
		</div>
	  <div class="p">
		Fade to silence as we do a few "heart-beat-cut-to-black-flashes"
		montages that imply that the parent's get killed. Either violence, or
		maybe just stress. We catch words here and there to get an idea. Would
		it be too corny to have a heart monitor going over this? Obviously
		this is all over the top, but I really want to play it sincere.
	  </div>
	  <div class="p">
		Now the void between the cuts starts to shorten. As we move up to the
		present and where the main action of the movie really starts. In a
		theatrical release, I could see the history playing out during the
		opening credits. In a comic book, as a "Prologue". I like this because
		if we spend about half the preview on this, we'll still have a real
		draw, but we don't have to give much of the movie away. (This next bit
		is still memory, just recent memory, clearer, sharper...)
	  </div>
	  <div class="p">
		"One brother vows to destroy the evils of this world whatever it
		takes... swallowing his compassion and hardening his heart, he trades
		his soul to become an avenger."
	  </div>
	  <div class="p">
		Scenes of meetings, purchasing weapons, some kind of battle or bank
		robbery or whatever... in an anti-apocalypse, maybe he's something
		like the guy in Fight Club? But not yet restrained, definetly
		resorting to violence, though it's clearly hard. In the back story, it
		would be very few deaths, I still think he's careful, but in the
		movie, we focus on a few moments... a comarade trips, we see or hear
		him getting killed as the brother tears himself away to escape a
		hopeless situation, a bystander accidentally gets caught in the
		crossfire. These weigh heavy on the brother's mind.
	  </div>
	  <div class="p">
		Different voice, implicitly from the other brother: "It wasn't just my
		parents who died that day. My brother... he's dying as well..."
	  </div>
	  <div class="p">
		We come up as if someone with their head bowed and eyes closed
		(implicitly, it's the younger brother who's memorie's we've been
		seeing, raising his head and looking at the master.) "Teach me to save
		him." (Would it be too much to have faint heart beating and breathing
		the entire time that we don't even notice at first, but which gets
		louder and louder until it cuts off and we hear an intake of breath to
		speak those words?
	  </div>
	  <div class="p">
		That's where the movie begins, so now we do fast cut montages. Back to
		the voiceover guy. We focus mainly on training scenes with a few of
		the first action scenes (someone attacks the dojo?) as the climax of
		the preview. (So the last scene we see is within the first 15-30 min
		of the movie.)
	  </div>
	  <div class="p">
		"One man who's struggle to save his brother from a life of violence
		while still walking the path of peace leads him to a master..."
	  </div>
	  <div class="p">
		Voice of master: "You must have confidence in this choice..."
		(Backstory: the warrior monks will teach you to fight, but you must
		foreswear violence entirely. I want some of the same feeling I get when
		I think of the Marathon Monks in Japan... I mean, that's commitment.)
	  </div>
	  <div class="p">
		master: "You must be willing to die..."
	  </div>
	  <div class="p">
		younger brother: "I forgive you..."
	  </div>
	  <div class="p">
		master: "And should you die, I vow to commit myself to a life of
		penance."  (actually, this would be in the movie, but let's cut from
		the preview).
	  </div>
	  <div class="p">
		The master then brutally punches the student, sending him flying
		across the room. Maybe like a slow-mo kick that goes full speed at the
		moment of impact, sending the student across the room. (All that wolud
		be one 10-15 sec. sequence.
	  </div>
	  <div class="p">
		Training montage. Break and focus:
	  </div>
	  <div class="p">
		master: "First you must learn to fuse your weaker constitutions. The
		fire in you will not yield yet..."
	  </div>
	  <div class="p">
		Let next scene roll:
	  </div>
	  <div class="p">
		announcer: "He will seak the key to ultimate physical control"
	  </div>
	  <div class="p">
		master: "To fuse all three constitutions simultaneously... my master
		achieved it once..."
	  </div>
	  <div class="p">
		brother: "So it can be done?"
	  </div>
	  <div class="p">
		master: "It was a moment of sacrifice."
	  </div>
	  <div class="p">
		brother: "I wish to make each moment a sacrifice to my desire to free
		him..."
	  </div>
	  <div class="p">
		master: "Then let us begin."
	  </div>
	  <div class="p">
		Cresendo and white out; fade back to title: "Tridosha: The Warrior Within"
