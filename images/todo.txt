- the shadow on the seals peters out because at the point, we want the shadow
  to extend to a point as well. I think the best thing to do would be to
  copy the first shadow object, then upth spike ratio and slightly increase
  size so that the spikes protrude slightly at the tips. Center align the two
  objects and copy the blur from second. (May not work, but this is my
  thought.)
