Pro tip: Apply the backing card while the glue is too wet and it can slip
around and smear. If you prep the backing cards in batches (I did mine 8 at a
time) and then apply them in the same order. This gives the glue time to set
up.

Pro tip: To better stack the finished poster's, rotate each by 90 degrees.

Pro tip: If the image doesn't dictate that the cards be hung on one side of
the image, then alternating left and right orientations allows the finished
posters to stack better. A left / middle / right would be even better.
