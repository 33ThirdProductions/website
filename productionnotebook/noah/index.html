      This project is effectively cancelled. Optimistically, on indefinet hold
      as we would love to come back to it. The implied by the poster concept
      were just so compelling&mdash;and this started in 2008; 4 years before
      the Aronofsky's <i>Noah</i> was annonced&mdash;that it naturally led us
      to ponder the story behind it.
    </div>
    <div class="p">
      It seemed rich ground and after the posters where done in 2011, A good
      chunk of time was spent in 2012 developing the concept in my mind and
      starting to put together plans for a Kickstarter campaign.
    </div>
    <div class="p">
      Through some combination of perfectionism and plain old 'not enough
      time', the project was halted. Then when the trailers for
      Aronofsky's <i>Noah</i> came out we could only think "It looks great,
      but the lack of dinosaurs ruins it." It seemed inconceivable that the
      market wouldn't agree and the site was refreshed and we hashed out a
      simplified plan to develop the property, but after reviewing the
      existing projects on Kickstarter, we just couldn't pull the trigger.
    </div>
    <div class="p">
      The problem was one of credibility in our own mind. There's just too
      much unknown and we felt that we really needed to flesh out the script,
      get a firmer page count, and get a couple of pages of test art before
      launching a campaign. We just weren't comfortable asking people to fork
      over money for 'just the idea'.
    </div>
    <div class="p">
      As time and money permit, we do hope to return to this one day. Rough in
      more of the script and get a handful of finished pages. A first chapter
      perhaps done. At that point, we could legitimately promise the backers:
      "Yes, this will be done, and here's what you'll be getting."
    </div>
    <div class="p">
      That is of course if no one else hits on the brilliant idea of greatest
      disaster movie of all time... plus <i>Jurrasic Park</i>. Like the best
      ice cream with the most delicious cherry of all time on top. Honestly,
      we're constantly surprised that no one's beaten us to the punch yet on
      this one.
