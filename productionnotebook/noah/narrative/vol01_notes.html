    <h1>Volume I: The Corruption</h1>
    <h2>Overview Notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Noah and his family live far outside the city/corrupted area. A day
      or two travel to the city is ideal.</li>
      <li>In some way, Noah as been forced to reveal that he can speak with
      God (or can he?). Perhaps he has diverted some disaster, or saved some
      people from a disaster, something along these lines. This can be played
      out in the text, or can simply be referenced as a past event.</li>
      <li>The corrupt in power (perhaps a low-level “boss” type) has learned
      of Noah's supposed ability. He wishes to use this to his advantage, to
      foresee his own destiny or perhaps to plan a coup of some sort.</li>
      <li>The “Boss” sends a lieutenant and a group of mercenaries to kidnap
      Noah. Their instructions are to either bring Noah back alive or take a
      member of his family and leave behind a ransom note.</li>
      <li>Noah and his sons are warned of the attack just prior to the
      kidnappers arrival. This may be in the form of a vision, or perhaps
      something much more simple. At this point, it should probably not be
      made implicit to the reader exactly what has occurred, only that they
      have been warned. It may have been divine, it may have just been luck,
      or Noah may just be that vigilant.</li>
      <li>Noah and his sons fight off and kill the intruders, but a wife is
      taken hostage. Probably Noah's wife. Perhaps the intruders plan from the
      start was to send men to be slaughtered by Noah and sons as a
      distraction so that the lieutenant can get away with the wife. This
      works well because it shows that the corrupt do not value human life
      whatsoever, and gladly sacrifice their own men to gain what they
      want.</li>
      <li>Japeth, being the wisest, sets out in pursuit. He trails the
      intruders but stays hidden as he is still outnumbered. That night,
      Japeth sends a messenger such as a nomadic hunter to Noah with news that
      the intruders have entered the city.  The city is walled, but people can
      freely come and go as they please.</li>
      <li>Noah and Ham set out to meet Japeth. Shem, being fiercely loyal and
      taking pride in doing whatever duty is asked of him, stays behind with
      the remaining wives. Noah and Ham travel to the city, perhaps meeting
      with some adversity or a small combat scene along the way.</li>
      <li>Japeth reaches the city first and devises a plan, which is unknown
      to Noah or the reader. Japeth allows himself to be taken prisoner in
      lieu of Noah, who he claims is old and travels slowly. Japeth then sends
      word through a child or thief to Noah and Ham to meet him at a third
      location.</li>
      <li>Japeth bribes a guard to release himself and the wife. They flee and
      go to meet Noah and Ham at the third location. The guard has
      double-crossed Japeth and led the corrupt straight to the party
      members. But Japeth knew this would happen, and has set up the third
      location for a quick get away. Perhaps Japeth even sends a coded message
      with the child or thief to give Noah a “heads up” about what will be
      going down at the third meeting spot. A message that only Noah will
      understand, and can possibly be referenced earlier in the text to let
      the reader in on the secret as well. Noah may not know exactly what is
      going to take place, but he can garner just enough info from the
      message, knowing how Japeth thinks, to be prepared for what comes.</li>
      <li>Here a confrontation between the corrupted and Noah takes place,
      where they discuss his ability to talk to God. Then Japeth sets his plan
      in motion, and the party is able to escape.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Draft Script</h2>
  <div class="p">
    The script is laid out in the fashion of a movie script, only instead of
    scene by scene, we go page by page, panel by panel. We won't bother
    formatting until it's a little further along, so for now, it's just a
    rough <a href="vol01_script.txt">text file</a>.
