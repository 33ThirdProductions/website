    <h1>Genisis</h1>
    <div class="p">
      Alas, I don't remember the details, but My
      <a href="http://www.zanecorp.com/wiki/index.php?title=Noah:_The_Culling&action=history">idea
	log</a> says I made the entry for "Noah: The Culling" on November 5th,
	2008. I was probably thinking, "Why doesn't this exist?"
    </div>
    <div class="p">
      Since then, I'd contemplated different scenes and narrative threads and
      had originally concieved of the idea in cinematic terms. In December of
      2011, I put together the poster concept as the centerpiece for a series
      of posters shot in and around my birthday.
    </div>
    <h1>Dinosaurs</h1>
    <div class="p">
      The dinosaur concept has been integral from the beginning. The idea is
      to basically take the basic idea
      of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Earth_creationism">Young
      Earth creationism</a> (YEC) and specifically the idea that man and dinos
      coexisted as a <i>Jurassic Park</i> like element without the need for
      bringing them back to life. We lived with the dinos... and it wasn't
      pretty. Where did they go? The flood wiped them out. Why? Because they
      were part of the problem.
    </div>
    <div class="p">
      I should mention that in most YEC I've seen, the dinos were like other
      animals and are generally said to have been on the Ark, but died after
      the deluge due to environmental change. The 'Young Earth' version here
      is straight up narritive awesomeness and not any theological change. I
      do hope however that Young Earthers could see this tale and say, "Yep, I
      can get behind that."
    </div>
    <h1>Unicorn</h1>
    <div class="p">
      The unicorn was brought up by Christine Gibert shortly before the poster
      concept was set. There was a myth-meme regarding unicorns that the pair
      had been lost during the flood and the surviving unicorn had been
      granted eternal (bio) life as recognition for some sacrifice (and later
      tragically killed as part of the Authorian legends?).
    </div>
    <div class="p">
      I remember the story presented as something heard elsewhere, though I
      have not found a reference for the unicorn-Ark story, though it does
      mesh with the medieval myths surrounding unicorns. It doesn't really
      matter, though, it works and I like it. It works very well to have a
      recognized, noble, and now missing creature commit a great sacrifice in
      the story, and the unicorn fits the bill to a t.
    </div>
    <h1>Betrayal of Crows</h1>
    <div class="p">
      In <i>Volume V: The Ark</i>, one key sub-plot I've toyed with is the
      betrayal of the crows. I believe I have some notes on some underlying
      mythology here. The idea that crows somehow failed, and while not damned
      were cursed (to wit, their association with witches and ill omens) fits
      well with existing myths.
    </div>
    <div class="p">
      Specifically, the crows as beasts associated with man are called upon to
      give warning should danger approach. However, the a crow falls asleep
      allowing an attack on the Ark. As a result, the crows are no longegr
      favored and there exists slight emnity forevermore.
    </div>
    <div class="p">
      The <a href="http://perspectiveszine.webnode.sk/news/ravens-and-crows-in-mythology-folklore-and-religion/">Western
      medieval/European and Christian myths mentioned here</a> get to the
      idea.
