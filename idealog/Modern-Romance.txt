Modern Romance video sketch. In my mind, Lady GaGa's Bad Romance fits.

Originally noted similar story sometime in 2013, but overwritten while trying
to clear files off desktop. FUUUUUUCCCK. In my pessimistic heart, that one was
better written, fresher conception.

Starts off with one male, one femail principals in sexy outfits. Theatrical background
suggestive of a party perhaps. Heavy flirting, making out, lights dim, perhaps
background change. Sexy dancing. While dancing, Another male and female appear
on ends of stage, each sees opposite over shoulder. Light dims in middle, and
the new principals move toward center, joined by opposite sex. More sexy
dancing, split and females head toward center, eye each other, and they start
sexy dancing. First male walks in, anger / fight dancing, then second male
appears and first male kind of gives a shrug, then f/f and m/m sexy dance for
a bit, till they all come together in center. I see something like the first
pair in center, f-f-m-m to make it 'edgier', with finale every pivots to face
front with center pair doing a kind of jazz-hands to cover crotch of principal
on either side, with the outer principals sort of hugging from behind while
looking at each other.
